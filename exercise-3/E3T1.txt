# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
- I tried to attack the simulate server many times but there is only an issue was detected: Recon:EC2/PortProbeUnprotectedPort - Low
(An EC2 instance has an unprotected port that is being probed by a known malicious host.)


# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

AWS GuardDuty detects the "Recon:EC2/PortProbeUnprotectedPort" finding through the analysis of VPC flow logs.
Here's how GuardDuty may have detected this attack:

+ Data Source: VPC Flow Logs: GuardDuty leverages VPC flow logs, which capture information about network traffic entering and leaving network interfaces within an Amazon VPC.
These logs include details such as source IP addresses, destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, and more.

+ Unprotected Port Probing: GuardDuty analyzes VPC flow logs to detect instances of unprotected port probing. An unprotected port is a port that is not blocked by security groups,
network access control lists (ACLs), or on-host firewalls. This means the port is open and accessible.

+ Known Malicious Hosts: GuardDuty maintains a repository of threat intelligence data from various sources, which includes information about known malicious IP addresses.
These are IP addresses associated with attackers, scanners, or malicious activities.

+ Active Probing Detection: When GuardDuty observes that a known malicious host is actively probing an unprotected port on an EC2 instance,
it triggers the "Recon:EC2/PortProbeUnprotectedPort" finding.

+ Severity Level: The finding's severity level is typically Low by default. However, if the port being probed is a well-known port associated with specific services
(such as port 9200 for Elasticsearch or port 9300 for Elasticsearch transport), the severity level is elevated to High. 
This indicates that there might be more critical services running on those ports.

+ Actionable Insights and Remediation: The finding provides insights into the potential vulnerability, including the unprotected port and the activity of known malicious hosts probing it.
GuardDuty recommends remediation actions, such as securing the port by applying security group rules, network ACLs, or on-host firewalls.

In summary, AWS GuardDuty uses VPC flow logs to monitor network traffic and detect instances of unprotected port probing.
It relies on threat intelligence data to identify known malicious hosts engaging in this activity. 
The detection helps us identify potential security risks and take necessary actions to mitigate them, ultimately enhancing the security of the AWS environment.
